# Contrast-and-Clarity-Optimizer
Contrast and Clarity Optimizer is a project that helps to enhance the visibility of real-world objects in real time using basic Computer Vision techniques such as image preprocessing. The tool uses grayscale conversion, contrast enhancement, color-space operations, and edge detection to improve clarity in low-contrast environments.
